And on February 13, 2017, they died together.</p><p>Abby and Libby, as their friends and family called them, were found by a search party on Valentine’s Day, around 18 hours after they had been reported missing.</p><p>Their bodies were hidden in the undergrowth on a remote hiking trail near their hometown of Delphi, Indiana, in the American Midwest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_1152385895.jpg><p>They had been placed alongside one another, and although police have not released any details of the cause of death, it was clear they had been murdered.</p><p>Abby and Libby’s deaths reverberated through the small town, because it was unlikely that anyone other than a local would have known about the track the girls were walking on that day.</p><p>What was once an open community became wracked with fear and suspicion – who could have committed such a crime? And did Libby’s mobile phone hold the answer?</p><p>Shortly before their deaths, Libby posted two photographs on Snapchat. One showed Abby in the foreground as the teens crossed an abandoned railroad bridge over Deer Creek, the other was a black and white shot of the bridge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/abby-on-the-bridge-libby-german-snapchat.jpg><p>But police also found a video on her phone, showing a man several yards away walking towards them. In the footage he is wearing jeans, a blue jacket, a brown hoodie and a hat. His head is down and he says four words: “Guys, down the hill.” It sounds like an order.</p><p>Almost three years on, however, the Snapchat Murders – as the girls’ death has been dubbed – remains a mystery. Abby’s mum, Anna Williams, 35, is hopeful the murderer will be brought to justice but, she says, it won’t alleviate her grief.</p><p>“If he is found I’ll sleep a bit better knowing that he can’t hurt anyone else, but it doesn’t bring my kid back,” she exclusively tells Fabulous.</p><p>“He can rot in jail or they can give him the death penalty and put a needle in his arm… It will just be a piece of the puzzle put into place. But Abby will still be the piece that’s missing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Libby-German-snapchat-photograph.jpg><p>Abby and Libby were in eighth grade at Delphi Community High School and had become best friends 18 months before they died through their shared interests in sport and music. Abby also loved reading, and her prized possession was her Kindle.</p><p>An only child whose dad hadn’t been around since before she was born, she lived with Anna and her grandmother and was close to her extended family.</p><p>Libby, meanwhile, lived with her grandfather Mike Patty, 54, and grandmother, Becky, 60. Her parents had split when she was three, and since then Libby and her older sister Kelsi had been raised by their grandparents and father Derrick, who also lived in Delphi.</p><p>“The day before they died, I took Abby and Libby to the park where they played catch,” says Anna. “Libby asked if Abby could stay the night at hers, so I dropped them there for a sleepover.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-09-at-13.56.10-e1569544824219.png><p>"The next day – Monday – I talked to Abby on the phone in between my shifts. The girls had a school holiday and she asked if she could stay until dinnertime. I told her I’d pick her up around 8pm when I finished work.”</p><p>Monday, February 13 was an unseasonably warm day and at about 1.30pm the girls decided to hike along the Delphi Historic Trails in Carroll County, which was a short drive out of town and an area they were familiar with.</p><p>They were dropped off near the abandoned Monon High Bridge by Libby’s sister Kelsi. Libby’s father Derrick planned to pick them up later at 3.15pm. The girls knew the area and took their phones.</p><p>At 2.07pm Libby posted the Snapchat photos. It was the last contact they made. According to an account given by her grandmother Becky, Derrick called Libby’s phone just before he arrived at the predetermined pick-up point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shutterstock_755475394.jpg><p>There was no answer, nor any sign of the girls once he got there. By 4pm Libby’s family began calling friends to try to locate them.</p><p>It was out of character for the girls not to tell parents where they were and at 5.30pm the Carroll County Sheriff’s Department was contacted and the girls were reported missing.</p><p>Anna was at work in her bar job and received a call from Becky around the same time. “I didn’t overly panic at first, because I thought they were at the park and had lost track of time,” she explains.</p><p>“We called friends, knocked at houses and posted on Facebook to see if anyone knew where they were. I was pacing the sheriff’s office thinking: ‘She is so grounded’. At that point I was certain they’d got lost. They were good kids – they didn’t take off without telling anyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_17068794156193.jpg><p>“As the night wore on, my main worry was that they’d got lost or hurt. Neither of them were great with directions. They hadn’t eaten, they were both in flimsy clothes and not prepared for the drop in temperature that night.</p><p>"I went back to the house and grabbed Abby’s jacket because she was going to need it when we found her.” Sniffer dogs were brought in to search the trail.</p><p>“Everyone was getting more upset, but we still didn’t have evidence that anyone else was involved. No one saw them talking to anyone. No one saw a vehicle in the area,” remembers Anna.</p><p>“I went out with a search party and they used flashlights to look in the river that ran under the bridge. I told them: ‘We are not looking for bodies, we are looking for two grounded little girls’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/rich-van-wyk-twitter-C4zPedmXUAAzn73.jpg><p>The operation was based at the local fire station and although the official search was halted in the early hours, people still looked for the girls through the night.</p><p>By the next morning, when the official operation continued, Anna was deeply worried but still convinced that they would be found in the woods – cold, scared, hungry, but alive.</p><p>She slowly recounts the moment when her world ended. “I was in the fire station talking to someone on the phone. It was around noon and our old pastor came → walking towards me. He said we needed to go upstairs.</p><p>I knew it wasn’t good. Before he said it, I knew what he was going to say. He told me the girls had been found and they were not alive. I don’t remember much after that for the next day or so. My life just fell apart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lindsay-Jacobson-ABC-News-09-09-at-14.38.10-e1569545801513.png><p>“The first year was a blur. That first Christmas I started an initiative called Abby’s Angels. We filled shoe boxes with toys and school equipment for deprived children overseas. We sent out 324.</p><p>"Last year we were on the second round of birthdays since they died and nothing had changed. I still struggle with going to a lot of family functions because there are new couples and new babies.</p><p>"Everyone is there except for one, and I’m by myself. Of course, I want to be with my family so badly, but it’s overwhelming and exhausting.</p><p>"Abby would have loved the new additions to the family, she would have loved going to the weddings.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/j.kylekenner-pharos-tribune-ap2.jpg><p>Anna is also one of the board members of the Abby And Libby Memorial Park charity, which aims to build a £800,000 park and sports centre in memory of the girls.</p><p>The project was launched in June this year and raised £40,000 within a few weeks, which the state government has pledged to match. Anna says: “It’s an ongoing project.</p><p>Both the girls loved the outdoors so it’s a way to recognise that. Work has started on the ball park now, and we are still moving ahead with it all.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the investigation has rumbled on. A still of Bridge Guy, as the man was quickly dubbed, was taken from Abby’s video and released the day after the bodies were found.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MugShot_2JPG-JS339994202.jpg><p>The suspect  who is wanted for the deaths of Abigail Joyce Williams, 13, and Liberty Rose Lynn German, 14, whose bodies were found Feb. 14 in a wooded area near the Delphi Historic Trail in Carroll County  was described by state police as about 5 feet 8 and between 180 and 220 pounds, with reddish-brown hair.</p><p>On February 19 he was named as the primary suspect, and a short audio clip of his voice was released three days later. An artist’s impression followed in July 2017, along with a renewed appeal.</p><p>With the cause of the girls’ deaths still not being released so as not to jeopardise the investigation, and the scant details from the authorities, the community and the families remain in the dark.</p><p>The absence of information has been filled by conspiracy and speculation – some horrific, with online theories suggesting that the girls were decapitated, that family members were in on it, or that the girls were abducted and are still alive.</p><h2>'BRIDGE GUY'</h2><p>In April this year, officials issued a new sketch of another suspect, apparently younger than Bridge Guy, and announced they were looking for information about the driver of a car that was parked at offices in the town on the day the girls disappeared.</p><p>At the same press conference they also finally released a clip of the video showing Bridge Guy walking towards the girls and saying: “Guys, down the hill.” It was the first time Anna had seen the footage. “I watched and listened and there was a weird sigh of relief because it wasn’t someone I recognised,” she says.</p><p>In the two years since the murders, there have been several suspects, but all have been discounted. Then, in July, police announced they were considering a recently deceased 55-year-old man named Paul Etter as another possible suspect.</p><p>Etter, from Tippecanoe County, 25 miles from Delphi, had shot and killed himself the previous month after a five-hour standoff with police, who were trying to arrest him in connection with the kidnapping and rape of a 26-year-old woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AP_19112668093975.jpg><p>Police requested autopsy results and DNA samples, but have made no further announcements and will only say that he is a possible suspect.</p><p>Anna has heard it all before. “It’s nothing new,” she says. “A guy kidnapped a woman, assaulted her, then returned her. There was a big manhunt for eight days and he committed suicide.</p><p>"Whenever there’s a case of interest in the area it gets linked to us. If there is something to talk about, the state police will call us.”</p><p>Two and a half years on, despite 30,000 leads, DNA analysis and an exhaustive investigation, no one has been arrested and frustrated family members have taken matters into their own hands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/j.kylekenner-pharos-tribune-ap3.jpg><p>There is a Twitter feed, a website and a Facebook page run by Libby’s family, and in July, Kelsi took to YouTube to debunk the conspiracy theories in a live two-hour broadcast.</p><p>It seems, however, police may know more than they can divulge. At the press conference in April, police hinted that they may know the identity of the murderer.</p><p>“Directly to the killer, who may be in this room: We believe you’re hiding in plain sight. We’ve likely interviewed you or someone close to you,” said Indiana State Police superintendent Doug Carter, his voice cracking.</p><p>“The conviction in Doug’s face was intense,” recalls Anna. “You could have heard a pin drop. You could feel the tension, it was chilling. I have to have confidence that the police are doing their job.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>"They are all working for us. Hopefully they know who it is, but they haven’t got the evidence yet to make an arrest.</p><p>“Knowing that it might be someone in the community makes you look at people all the time. Sometimes I pass someone, and my hair stands up. It’s strange.</p><p>"But if the person is here in a community of less than 5,000 people, how the hell haven’t we figured out who it is yet?”</p><ul><li><strong><strong>To donate to the Abby And Libby Memorial Park visit <a href=#>Abbyandlibbymemorialpark.org</a>.</strong></strong><br><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Boyfriend tells court how Jodie Chesney collapsed after being fatally stabbed in East London</span></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BpZ2lwYGaEcL%2FNmqecoJGpeq7B0Z2cq2WdrsC1sdGyZK2dlaPAbrPIq6OsZw%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html&title=Two%20teenage%20girls%20filmed%20a%20man%20on%20their%20phone%20just%20before%20they%20were%20killed%20%20so%20why%20have%20police%20no" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html&description=Two%20teenage%20girls%20filmed%20a%20man%20on%20their%20phone%20just%20before%20they%20were%20killed%20%20so%20why%20have%20police%20no" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html&title=Two%20teenage%20girls%20filmed%20a%20man%20on%20their%20phone%20just%20before%20they%20were%20killed%20%20so%20why%20have%20police%20no" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html&title=Two%20teenage%20girls%20filmed%20a%20man%20on%20their%20phone%20just%20before%20they%20were%20killed%20%20so%20why%20have%20police%20no" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html&text=Two%20teenage%20girls%20filmed%20a%20man%20on%20their%20phone%20just%20before%20they%20were%20killed%20%20so%20why%20have%20police%20no" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fsnapchat-murder-mystery-teens-girls.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Martina Birk</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-12</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./lauren-london-parents.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Who Are 'You People' Star Lauren London's Parents?</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./nancy-benoit-hustler-pics-reach-supreme-court.html><h3>Nancy Benoit Hustler PICS Reach Supreme Court >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
