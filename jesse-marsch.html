He was born to his father, Larry Marsch, and his mother, whose name is still not revealed on the internet.</p><p></p><p>Marsch was not only the kid in the family. The star grows up alongside his sister Sara Marsch and two other siblings.</p><p>Well, nothing precisely has been detailed on the information about his childhood, early life, and parents.</p><p>But yes, as a kid, Jesse never dreamed of being a coach to a national team or any other team. He was not so genuine and thoughtful about his future.</p><p>To add on, when Jesse turned fifteen, he was on tour with an American regional side at a youth tournament in the U.K. Actually, they went to Anfield to watch <a href=# rel=noopener>Liverpool</a>.</p><p>After watching John Barnes and Peter Beardsley play, what made him do that, but he just went down the pitch took some Arsenal turf as a memoir, pondering on the fact whether he will ever again have a chance to be there or not.</p><p>Now we can ponder that must be a specific moment when Jesse almost felt like a true athlete somewhere in his heart.</p><h2>Jesse Marsch | Playing Career</h2><h3>High School and College Career</h3><p>Jesse attended Racin Case High School and accomplished his high school career as a standout athlete.&nbsp;</p><p>He then went on attending Princeton University and also earned All-American honors in 1995 after notching 16 goals as a midfielder and forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Marsch-in-action-747x1024.jpeg><p>His collegiate career coach was Bob Bradley, who also guided him overall in the MLS draft in 1996. He later served as an assistant at DC United.</p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>DC United, a professional soccer club based in Washington, DC, hired him for the 1996 MLS college draft in the third round. For the next two seasons, he played for DC, appearing in a total of 15 games.</p><p>Furthermore, when Bob was assigned to lead the Chicago Fire expansion, he obtained Jesse too.&nbsp;</p><p>Jesse was hired in place of A.J. Wood and a sound round pick-up in the 1998 college draft. While performing regularly for the Chicago Fire, he quite soon became a pillar of the troop there.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Dane Dunning Bio: Early Life, MLB, Personal Life & Salary >></a></strong></p><p>Well, Jesse also aided his team Fire to the 1998 MLS Cup, winning over three league championships in three seasons.</p><p>Not only that, but he also won the U.S Open Cup, a knockout cup competition in men’s soccer, three times in 1998, 2000, and 2003. He also became the club’s all-time leader in regular-season games.</p><p>After his outstanding sportsmanship with the Fires, Jesse was traded to Chivas USA, where Bob was officially coaching in 2005.</p><p>After spending a few seasons with the Chivas, he declared his retirement and planned to enter coaching on February 5, 2010.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Jesse earned two caps with the United States national team. His first cap was earned as a relief in the World Cup qualifier tie with Trinidad and Tobago in 2001.
